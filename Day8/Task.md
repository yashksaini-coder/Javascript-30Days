# Day 8: ES6+ Features 🚀

Welcome to Day 8 of our JavaScript workshop! Today, we will dive into some of the powerful features introduced in ES6 and beyond. 🌟

## Learning Objectives 📚

By the end of these activities, you will:
- Understand and use template literals for string interpolation and multi-line strings.
- Apply destructuring to extract values from arrays and objects.
- Utilize spread and rest operators for array manipulation and function arguments.
- Define functions with default parameters.
- Create objects using enhanced object literals, including methods and computed property names.

## Activities 🛠️

This workshop is divided into several activities:

### Activity 1: Template Literals ✨

- [ ] **Task 1:** Use template literals to create a string that includes variables for a person's name and age, and log the string to the console.
- [ ] **Task 2:** Create a multi-line string using template literals and log it to the console.

### Activity 2: Destructuring 🛠️

- [ ] **Task 3:** Use array destructuring to extract the first and second elements from an array of numbers and log them to the console.
- [ ] **Task 4:** Use object destructuring to extract the title and author from a book object and log them to the console.

### Activity 3: Spread and Rest Operators 📌

- [ ] **Task 5:** Use the spread operator to create a new array that includes all elements of an existing array plus additional elements, and log the new array to the console.
- [ ] **Task 6:** Use the rest operator in a function to accept an arbitrary number of arguments, sum them, and return the result.

### Activity 4: Default Parameters 🔧

- [ ] **Task 7:** Write a function that takes two parameters and returns their product, with the second parameter having a default value of 1. Log the result of calling this function with and without the second parameter.

### Activity 5: Enhanced Object Literals ⚙️

- [ ] **Task 8:** Use enhanced object literals to create an object with methods and properties, and log the object to the console.
- [ ] **Task 9:** Create an object with computed property names based on variables and log the object to the console.

## Feature Requests (Optional) 🎨

1. **Template Literals Script:** Write a script that demonstrates the use of template literals to create and log strings with embedded variables and multi-line strings.
2. **Destructuring Script:** Create a script that uses array and object destructuring to extract values and log them.
3. **Spread and Rest Operators Script:** Write a script that demonstrates the use of the spread operator to combine arrays and the rest operator to handle multiple function arguments.
4. **Default Parameters Script:** Create a script that defines a function with default parameters and logs the results of calling it with different arguments.
5. **Enhanced Object Literals Script:** Write a script that uses enhanced object literals to create and log an object with methods and computed property names.
