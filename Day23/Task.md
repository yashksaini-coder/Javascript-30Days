Welcome to Day 23! Today, we're diving into some of the most challenging problems on LeetCode. These tasks will test your algorithmic skills and help you become proficient in solving complex problems. Let's conquer these challenges! 🌟

## Tasks/Activities 📝

### Activity 1: Median of Two Sorted Arrays 📊
- [X] **Task 1:** Solve the "Median of Two Sorted Arrays" problem on LeetCode.
  - Write a function that takes two sorted arrays of integers and returns the median of the two sorted arrays.
  - Log the median for a few test cases, including edge cases.

### Activity 2: Merge k Sorted Lists 🔗
- [X] **Task 2:** Solve the "Merge k Sorted Lists" problem on LeetCode.
  - Write a function that takes an array of k linked lists, each sorted in ascending order, and merges them into one sorted linked list.
  - Create a few test cases with linked lists and log the merged list.

### Activity 3: Trapping Rain Water 🌧️
- [X] **Task 3:** Solve the "Trapping Rain Water" problem on LeetCode.
  - Write a function that takes an array of non-negative integers representing an elevation map, where the width of each bar is 1, and computes how much water it can trap after raining.
  - Log the amount of trapped water for a few test cases.

### Activity 4: N-Queens ♟️
- [X] **Task 4:** Solve the "N-Queens" problem on LeetCode.
  - Write a function that places n queens on an n x n chessboard such that no two queens attack each other, and returns all distinct solutions to the n-queens puzzle.
  - Log the distinct solutions for a few test cases.

### Activity 5: Word Ladder 🪜
- [X] **Task 5:** Solve the "Word Ladder" problem on LeetCode.
  - Write a function that takes a begin word, an end word, and a dictionary of words, and finds the length of the shortest transformation sequence from the begin word to the end word. Each transformation can only change one letter, and each transformed word must exist in the word list.
  - Log the length of the shortest transformation sequence for a few test cases.
