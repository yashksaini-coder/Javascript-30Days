# Day 20: LocalStorage and SessionStorage 📦

Welcome to Day 20! Today, we're diving into the world of web storage with **LocalStorage** and **SessionStorage**. These tools allow you to store data directly in the user's browser, making it easy to save and retrieve information across sessions or within a single session. Let's explore how to use them effectively! 🌐

## Tasks/Activities 📝

### Activity 1: Understanding LocalStorage 📚

- [X] **Task 1:** Write a script to save a string value to `localStorage` and retrieve it. Log the retrieved value.
- [X] **Task 2:** Write a script to save an object to `localStorage` by converting it to a JSON string. Retrieve and parse the object, then log it.

### Activity 2: Using LocalStorage 🛠️

- [X] **Task 3:** Create a simple form that saves user input (e.g., name and email) to `localStorage` when submitted. Retrieve and display the saved data on page load.
- [X] **Task 4:** Write a script to remove an item from `localStorage`. Log the `localStorage` content before and after removal.

### Activity 3: Understanding SessionStorage 🧠

- [X] **Task 5:** Write a script to save a string value to `sessionStorage` and retrieve it. Log the retrieved value.
- [X] **Task 6:** Write a script to save an object to `sessionStorage` by converting it to a JSON string. Retrieve and parse the object, then log it.

### Activity 4: Using SessionStorage 🔄

- [X] **Task 7:** Create a simple form that saves user input (e.g., name and email) to `sessionStorage` when submitted. Retrieve and display the saved data on page load.
- [X] **Task 8:** Write a script to remove an item from `sessionStorage`. Log the `sessionStorage` content before and after removal.

### Activity 5: Comparing LocalStorage and SessionStorage ⚖️

- [X] **Task 9:** Write a function that accepts a key and a value, and saves the value to both `localStorage` and `sessionStorage`. Retrieve and log the values from both storage mechanisms.
- [X] **Task 10:** Write a function that clears all data from both `localStorage` and `sessionStorage`. Verify that both storages are empty.

## Feature Request 🎯

1. **LocalStorage Script:** Write a script that saves, retrieves, and removes items from `localStorage`, and displays the saved data on page load.
2. **SessionStorage Script:** Create a script that saves, retrieves, and removes items from `sessionStorage`, and displays the saved data on page load.
3. **Storage Comparison Script:** Write a script that saves data to both `localStorage` and `sessionStorage`, retrieves the data, and compares the results.
4. **Clear Storage Script:** Create a script that clears all data from both `localStorage` and `sessionStorage`, and verifies the operation.

## Achievement Unlocked 🏆

By the end of these activities, you will:

- ✅ Understand how to use **LocalStorage** and **SessionStorage** for persistent and session-specific data storage.
- ✅ Save, retrieve, and remove data from both **LocalStorage** and **SessionStorage**.
- ✅ Implement form data storage using **LocalStorage** and **SessionStorage**.
- ✅ Compare and contrast the use cases for **LocalStorage** and **SessionStorage**.
