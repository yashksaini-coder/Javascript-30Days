# Day 24: Project 1 - Weather App ☀️🌧️

Welcome to your first project! Today, you'll be building a dynamic Weather App that fetches real-time weather data, displays a 5-day forecast, and provides an interactive user experience. Let's get started! 🚀

## Tasks/Activities 📝

### Activity 1: Setting Up the Project 🛠️
- [X] **Task 1:** Initialize a new project directory and set up the basic HTML structure for the weather app.
- [X] **Task 2:** Add a basic CSS file to style the weather app, including a container for displaying weather information.

### Activity 2: Fetching Weather Data 🌍
- [X] **Task 3:** Use the Fetch API to get current weather data from a public weather API (e.g., OpenWeatherMap). Log the response data to the console.
- [X] **Task 4:** Parse the weather data and display the current temperature, weather condition, and city name on the web page.

### Activity 3: Adding Search Functionality 🔍
- [X] **Task 5:** Add an input field and a search button to the HTML structure. Style the input and button using CSS.
- [X] **Task 6:** Write a function to fetch and display weather data for a city entered in the search input field. Log any errors to the console.

### Activity 4: Displaying the Forecast 📅
- [X] **Task 7:** Use the Fetch API to get the weather forecast from the public weather API. Log the response data to the console.
- [X] **Task 8:** Parse the forecast data and display the temperature and weather condition for each day in the forecast on the web page.

### Activity 5: Enhancing the UI 🎨
- [X] **Task 9:** Add icons or images to represent different weather conditions (e.g., sunny, rainy, cloudy) based on the weather data.
- [X] **Task 10:** Add CSS animations or transitions to make the weather app more interactive and visually appealing.
