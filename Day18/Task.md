# Day 18: Algorithms üöÄ

Welcome to Day 18 of our coding adventure! Today, we're diving deep into algorithms, the heart of computer science. Understanding these fundamental algorithms will significantly enhance your problem-solving skills. Let's sort, search, and optimize our way through the day!

## Tasks/Activities üìù

### Activity 1: Sorting Algorithms

- [X] **Task 1:** Implement the **bubble sort** algorithm to sort an array of numbers in ascending order. Log the sorted array.
- [X] **Task 2:** Implement the **selection sort** algorithm to sort an array of numbers in ascending order. Log the sorted array.
- [X] **Task 3:** Implement the **quicksort** algorithm to sort an array of numbers in ascending order. Log the sorted array.

### Activity 2: Searching Algorithms

- [X] **Task 4:** Implement the **linear search** algorithm to find a target value in an array. Log the index of the target value.
- [X] **Task 5:** Implement the **binary search** algorithm to find a target value in a sorted array. Log the index of the target value.

### Activity 3: String Algorithms

- [X] **Task 6:** Write a function to **count the occurrences** of each character in a string. Log the character counts.
- [X] **Task 7:** Write a function to find the **longest substring without repeating characters** in a string. Log the length of the substring.

### Activity 4: Array Algorithms
