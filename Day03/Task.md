# Day 3: Control Structures

Welcome to Day 3 of our JavaScript workshop! Today, we will delve into control structures, which allow us to control the flow of our programs. 🎉

## Learning Objectives 📚

By the end of these activities, you will:
- Implement and understand basic if-else control flow.
- Use nested if-else statements to handle multiple conditions.
- Utilize switch cases for control flow based on specific values.
- Apply the ternary operator for concise condition checking.
- Combine multiple conditions to solve more complex problems.

## Activities 🛠️

This workshop is divided into several activities:

### Activity 1: If-Else Statements :sparkles:

- [X] **Task 1:** Write a program to check if a number is positive, negative, or zero, and log the result to the console.
- [X] **Task 2:** Write a program to check if a person is eligible to vote (age >= 18) and log the result to the console.

### Activity 2: Nested If-Else Statements 🔄

- [X] **Task 3:** Write a program to find the largest of three numbers using nested if-else statements.

### Activity 3: Switch Case 🔀

- [X] **Task 4:** Write a program that uses a switch case to determine the day of the week based on a number (1-7) and log the day name to the console.
- [X] **Task 5:** Write a program that uses a switch case to assign a grade ('A', 'B', 'C', 'D', 'F) based on a score and log the grade to the console.

### Activity 4: Conditional (Ternary) Operator ❓

- [X] **Task 6:** Write a program that uses the ternary operator to check if a number is even or odd and log the result to the console.

### Activity 5: Combining Conditions 🔗

- [X] **Task 7:** Write a program to check if a year is a leap year using multiple conditions (divisible by 4, but not 100 unless also divisible by 400) and log the result to the console.

## Feature Requests (Optional) 🎨

1. **Number Check Script:** Write a script that checks if a number is positive, negative, or zero using if-else statements and logs the result.
2. **Voting Eligibility Script:** Write a script that checks if a person is eligible to vote (age >= 18) and logs the result.
3. **Day of the Week Script:** Write a script that uses a switch case to determine the day of the week based on a number (1-7) and logs the day name.
4. **Grade Assignment Script:** Create a script that uses a switch case to assign a grade based on a score and logs the grade.
5. **Leap Year Check Script:** Write a script that checks if a year is a leap year using multiple conditions and logs the result.

Happy coding! 💻✨
