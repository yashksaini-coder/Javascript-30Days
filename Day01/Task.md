# JavaScript Basics: Variables and Data Types

Welcome to the hands-on introduction to variables and data types in JavaScript! 🚀

## Learning Objectives 📚

By the end of these activities, you will:
- Know how to declare variables using `var`, `let`, and `const`.
- Understand the different data types in JavaScript (number, string, boolean, object, array).
- Be able to use the `typeof` operator to identify the data type of a variable.
- Understand the concept of variable reassignment and the immutability of `const` variables.

## Activities 🛠️

This workshop is divided into several activities:

### Day 1: Variables and Data Types

#### Activity 1: Variable Declaration ✏️
1. **Task 1:** Declare a variable with `var`, assign a number, and log the value.
2. **Task 2:** Declare a variable with `let`, assign a string, and log the value.

#### Activity 2: Constant Declaration 🔒
3. **Task 3:** Declare a constant with `const`, assign a boolean value, and log the value.

#### Activity 3: Data Types 🔍
4. **Task 4:** Create variables of different data types and use `typeof` to log their types.

#### Activity 4: Reassigning Variables 🔄
5. **Task 5:** Declare a variable with `let`, assign a value, reassign it, and log both values.

#### Activity 5: Understanding `const` 🚫
6. **Task 6:** Try reassigning a constant and observe the error.

## Feature Requests (Optional) 🎨

- Create a script that logs the value and type of different data type variables.
- Write a script that demonstrates the difference between `let` and `const` reassignment.
