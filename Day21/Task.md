# Day 21: LeetCode Easy Problems 🚀

Welcome to Day 21! Today, we're tackling some classic problems on LeetCode. These exercises will help you sharpen your problem-solving skills and build confidence in solving coding challenges. Let's dive into it! 💪

## Tasks/Activities 📝

### Activity 1: Two Sum ➕
- [ ] **Task 1:** Solve the "Two Sum" problem on LeetCode.
  - Write a function that takes an array of numbers and a target number, and returns the indices of the two numbers that add up to the target.
  - Log the indices for a few test cases.

### Activity 2: Reverse Integer 🔄
- [ ] **Task 2:** Solve the "Reverse Integer" problem on LeetCode.
  - Write a function that takes an integer and returns it with its digits reversed.
  - Handle edge cases like negative numbers and numbers ending in zero.
  - Log the reversed integers for a few test cases.

### Activity 3: Palindrome Number 🔢
- [ ] **Task 3:** Solve the "Palindrome Number" problem on LeetCode.
  - Write a function that takes an integer and returns `true` if it is a palindrome, and `false` otherwise.
  - Log the result for a few test cases, including edge cases like negative numbers.

### Activity 4: Merge Two Sorted Lists 🔗
- [ ] **Task 4:** Solve the "Merge Two Sorted Lists" problem on LeetCode.
  - Write a function that takes two sorted linked lists and returns a new sorted list by merging them.
  - Create a few test cases with linked lists and log the merged list.

### Activity 5: Valid Parentheses ✔️❌
- [ ] **Task 5:** Solve the "Valid Parentheses" problem on LeetCode.
  - Write a function that takes a string containing just the characters '(', ')', '[', ']', '{', '}', and determines if the input string is valid.
  - A string is valid if open brackets are closed in the correct order.
  - Log the result for a few test cases.
