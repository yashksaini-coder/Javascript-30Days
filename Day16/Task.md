# Day 16: Recursion üîÅ

Welcome to Day 16 of our JavaScript workshop! Today, we'll explore the power of recursion. Recursion is a technique where a function calls itself to solve a problem. Let's dive into these tasks and master recursion!

## Tasks/Activities üìù

### Activity 1: Basic Recursion

- [X] **Task 1:** Write a recursive function to calculate the factorial of a number. Log the result for a few test cases.
- [X] **Task 2:** Write a recursive function to calculate the nth Fibonacci number. Log the result for a few test cases.

### Activity 2: Recursion with Arrays

- [X] **Task 3:** Write a recursive function to find the sum of all elements in an array. Log the result for a few test cases.
- [X] **Task 4:** Write a recursive function to find the maximum element in an array. Log the result for a few test cases.

### Activity 3: String Manipulation with Recursion

- [X] **Task 5:** Write a recursive function to reverse a string. Log the result for a few test cases.
- [X] **Task 6:** Write a recursive function to check if a string is a palindrome. Log the result for a few test cases.

### Activity 4: Recursive Search

- [X] **Task 7:** Write a recursive function to perform a binary search on a sorted array. Log the index of the target element for a few test cases.
- [X] **Task 8:** Write a recursive function to count the occurrences of a target element in an array. Log the result for a few test cases.

### Activity 5: Tree Traversal (Optional)

- [X] **Task 9:** Write a recursive function to perform an in-order traversal of a binary tree. Log the nodes as they are visited.
- [X] **Task 10:** Write a recursive function to calculate the depth of a binary tree. Log the result for a few test cases.

## Feature Request üìã

1. **Factorial and Fibonacci Script:** Write a script that includes recursive functions to calculate the factorial and Fibonacci numbers.
2. **Array Recursion Script:** Create a script that includes recursive functions to find the sum and maximum element of an array.
3. **String Recursion Script:** Write a script that includes recursive functions to reverse a string and check if a string is a palindrome.
4. **Recursive Search Script:** Create a script that includes recursive functions for binary search and counting occurrences in an array.
5. **Tree Traversal Script:** Write a script that includes recursive functions for in-order traversal and depth calculation of a binary tree (optional).

## Achievement üéì

By the end of these activities, students will:

- ‚úÖ Understand and implement basic recursion.
- ‚úÖ Apply recursion to solve problems with arrays and strings.
- ‚úÖ Use recursion for searching and counting elements in arrays.
- ‚úÖ Perform tree traversal and calculate tree depth using recursion (optional).
