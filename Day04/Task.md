# Day 4: Loops

Welcome to Day 4 of our JavaScript workshop! Today, we will dive into loops, which allow us to repeat blocks of code efficiently. üéâ

## Learning Objectives üìö

By the end of these activities, you will:
- Understand and use `for` loops to iterate over a sequence of numbers.
- Utilize `while` loops for iteration based on a condition.
- Apply `do...while` loops to ensure the loop body is executed at least once.
- Implement nested loops to solve more complex problems.
- Use loop control statements (`break` and `continue`) to control the flow of loops.

## Activities üõ†Ô∏è

This workshop is divided into several activities:

### Activity 1: For Loop üîÅ

- [X] **Task 1:** Write a program to print numbers from 1 to 10 using a for loop.
- [X] **Task 2:** Write a program to print the multiplication table of 5 using a for loop.

### Activity 2: While Loop üîÑ

- [X] **Task 3:** Write a program to calculate the sum of numbers from 1 to 10 using a while loop.
- [X] **Task 4:** Write a program to print numbers from 10 to 1 using a while loop.

### Activity 3: Do...While Loop üîÇ

- [X] **Task 5:** Write a program to print numbers from 1 to 5 using a do...while loop.
- [X] **Task 6:** Write a program to calculate the factorial of a number using a do...while loop.

### Activity 4: Nested Loops üîÄ

- [X] **Task 7:** Write a program to print a pattern using nested for loops:
    ```
    *
    **
    ***
    ****
    *****
    ```

### Activity 5: Loop Control Statements ‚è≠Ô∏è

- [X] **Task 8:** Write a program to print numbers from 1 to 10, but skip the number 5 using the `continue` statement.
- [X] **Task 9:** Write a program to print numbers from 1 to 10, but stop the loop when the number is 7 using the `break` statement.

## Feature Requests (Optional) üé®`

1. **Number Printing Script:** Write a script that prints numbers from 1 to 10 using a for loop and a while loop.
2. **Multiplication Table Script:** Create a script that prints the multiplication table of 5 using a for loop.
3. **Pattern Printing Script:** Write a script that prints a pattern of stars using nested loops.
4. **Sum Calculation Script:** Write a script that calculates the sum of numbers from 1 to 10 using a while loop.
5. **Factorial Calculation Script:** Create a script that calculates the factorial of a number using a do...while loop.
