# Day 22: LeetCode Medium Problems 🚀

Welcome to Day 22! Today, we'll be tackling some medium-level challenges on LeetCode. These problems will push your problem-solving abilities and help you become more comfortable with advanced algorithms. Let's get started! 💪

## Tasks/Activities 📝

### Activity 1: Add Two Numbers ➕
- [X] **Task 1:** Solve the "Add Two Numbers" problem on LeetCode.
  - Write a function that takes two non-empty linked lists representing two non-negative integers. The digits are stored in reverse order, and each node contains a single digit. Add the two numbers and return the sum as a linked list.
  - Create a few test cases with linked lists and log the sum as a linked list.

### Activity 2: Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters 🔤
- [X] **Task 2:** Solve the "Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters" problem on LeetCode.
  - Write a function that takes a string and returns the length of the longest substring without repeating characters.
  - Log the length for a few test cases, including edge cases.

### Activity 3: Container With Most Water 💧
- [X] **Task 3:** Solve the "Container With Most Water" problem on LeetCode.
  - Write a function that takes an array of non-negative integers where each integer represents the height of a line drawn at each point. Find two lines that, together with the x-axis, form a container such that the container holds the most water.
  - Log the maximum amount of water for a few test cases.

### Activity 4: 3Sum 🌐
- [X] **Task 4:** Solve the "3Sum" problem on LeetCode.
  - Write a function that takes an array of integers and finds all unique triplets in the array which sum to zero.
  - Log the triplets for a few test cases, including edge cases.

### Activity 5: Group Anagrams 🅰️🅱️🅾️
- [X] **Task 5:** Solve the "Group Anagrams" problem on LeetCode.
  - Write a function that takes an array of strings and groups anagrams together.
  - Log the grouped anagrams for a few test cases.
