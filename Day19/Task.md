# Day 19: Regular Expressions üîç

Welcome to Day 19! Today, we're diving into the world of Regular Expressions (RegEx) ‚Äì a powerful tool for pattern matching and string manipulation. With RegEx, you can search, extract, and validate strings with precision. Let‚Äôs get started!

## Tasks/Activities üìù

### Activity 1: Basic Regular Expressions

- [ ] **Task 1:** Write a regular expression to match a simple pattern (e.g., match all occurrences of the word "JavaScript" in a string). Log the matches.
- [ ] **Task 2:** Write a regular expression to match all digits in a string. Log the matches.

### Activity 2: Character Classes and Quantifiers

- [ ] **Task 3:** Write a regular expression to match all words in a string that start with a capital letter. Log the matches.
- [ ] **Task 4:** Write a regular expression to match all sequences of one or more digits in a string. Log the matches.

### Activity 3: Grouping and Capturing

- [ ] **Task 5:** Write a regular expression to capture the area code, central office code, and line number from a US phone number format (e.g., (123) 456-7890). Log the captures.
- [ ] **Task 6:** Write a regular expression to capture the username and domain from an email address. Log the captures.

### Activity 4: Assertions and Boundaries

- [ ] **Task 7:** Write a regular expression to match a word only if it is at the beginning of a string. Log the matches.
- [ ] **Task 8:** Write a regular expression to match a word only if it is at the end of a string. Log the matches.

### Activity 5: Practical Applications

- [ ] **Task 9:** Write a regular expression to validate a simple password (must include at least one uppercase letter, one lowercase letter, one digit, and one special character). Log whether the password is valid.
- [ ] **Task 10:** Write a regular expression to validate a URL. Log whether the URL is valid.

## Feature Request üéØ

1. **Basic Regex Script:** Write a script that uses regular expressions to match simple patterns and log the matches.
2. **Character Classes and Quantifiers Script:** Create a script that uses regular expressions to match words with specific characteristics and log the matches.
3. **Grouping and Capturing Script:** Write a script that uses regular expressions to capture parts of a string, such as phone numbers and email addresses, and log the captures.
4. **Assertions and Boundaries Script:** Create a script that uses regular expressions to match words at specific positions in a string and log the matches.
5. **Validation Script:** Write a script that uses regular expressions to validate passwords and URLs and log whether they are valid.

## Achievement üèÜ

By the end of these activities, students will:

- ‚úÖ Understand and create **basic regular expressions**.
- ‚úÖ Use **character classes and quantifiers** in regular expressions.
- ‚úÖ Implement **grouping and capturing** in regular expressions.
- ‚úÖ Apply **assertions and boundaries** in regular expressions.
- ‚úÖ Use regular expressions for **practical applications** like validating passwords and URLs.
