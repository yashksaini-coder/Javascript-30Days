# Day 17: Data Structures 📊

Welcome to Day 17 of our JavaScript journey! Today, we're diving into essential data structures like Linked Lists, Stacks, Queues, Binary Trees, and even Graphs. Understanding these will help you manage and organize data more effectively in your applications. Let's get started!

## Tasks/Activities 📝

### Activity 1: Linked List

- [X] **Task 1:** Implement a `Node` class to represent an element in a linked list with properties `value` and `next`.
- [X] **Task 2:** Implement a `LinkedList` class with methods to add a node to the end, remove a node from the end, and display all nodes.

### Activity 2: Stack

- [X] **Task 3:** Implement a `Stack` class with methods `push` (add element), `pop` (remove element), and `peek` (view the top element).
- [X] **Task 4:** Use the `Stack` class to reverse a string by pushing all characters onto the stack and then popping them off.

### Activity 3: Queue

- [X] **Task 5:** Implement a `Queue` class with methods `enqueue` (add element), `dequeue` (remove element), and `front` (view the first element).
- [X] **Task 6:** Use the `Queue` class to simulate a simple printer queue where print jobs are added to the queue and processed in order.

### Activity 4: Binary Tree

- [X] **Task 7:** Implement a `TreeNode` class to represent a node in a binary tree with properties `value`, `left`, and `right`.
- [X] **Task 8:** Implement a `BinaryTree` class with methods for inserting values and performing in-order traversal to display nodes.

### Activity 5: Graph (Optional)

- [X] **Task 9:** Implement a `Graph` class with methods to add vertices, add edges, and perform a breadth-first search (BFS).
- [X] **Task 10:** Use the `Graph` class to represent a simple network and perform BFS to find the shortest path between two nodes.

## Feature Request 📋

1. **Linked List Script:** Write a script that implements a linked list with methods to add, remove, and display nodes.
2. **Stack Script:** Create a script that implements a stack and uses it to reverse a string.
3. **Queue Script:** Write a script that implements a queue and simulates a printer queue.
4. **Binary Tree Script:** Create a script that implements a binary tree with insertion and in-order traversal methods.
5. **Graph Script:** Write a script that implements a graph and performs breadth-first search (optional).

## Achievement 🎓

By the end of these activities, students will:

- ✅ Implement and use linked lists for dynamic data storage.
- ✅ Use stacks for LIFO (Last-In-First-Out) operations and reverse data.
- ✅ Use queues for FIFO (First-In-First-Out) operations and simulate real-world scenarios.
- ✅ Implement binary trees for hierarchical data storage and traversal.
- ✅ Understand and use graphs for network representations and pathfinding (optional).
