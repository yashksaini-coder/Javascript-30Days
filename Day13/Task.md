# Day 13: Modules üì¶

Welcome to Day 13 of our JavaScript workshop! Today, we will dive into the world of modules, learning how to create, export, and import them to keep our code organized and maintainable.

## Tasks/Activities üìù

### Activity 1: Creating and Exporting Modules

- [X] **Task 1:** Create a module that exports a function to add two numbers. Import and use this module in another script.
- [X] **Task 2:** Create a module that exports an object representing a person with properties and methods. Import and use this module in another script.

### Activity 2: Named and Default Exports

- [X] **Task 3:** Create a module that exports multiple functions using named exports. Import and use these functions in another script.
- [X] **Task 4:** Create a module that exports a single function using default export. Import and use this function in another script.

### Activity 3: Importing Entire Modules

- [X] **Task 5:** Create a module that exports multiple constants and functions. Import the entire module as an object in another script and use its properties.

### Activity 4: Using Third-Party Modules

- [X] **Task 6:** Install a third-party module (e.g., lodash) using npm. Import and use a function from this module in a script.
- [X] **Task 7:** Install a third-party module (e.g., axios) using npm. Import and use this module to make a network request in a script.

### Activity 5: Module Bundling (Optional)

- [X] **Task 8:** Use a module bundler like Webpack or Parcel to bundle multiple JavaScript files into a single file. Write a script to demonstrate the bundling process.

## Feature Request üìã

1. **Basic Module Script:** Write a script that creates a module exporting a function and imports it in another script.
2. **Named and Default Exports Script:** Create a script demonstrating both named and default exports and their usage.
3. **Third-Party Module Script:** Write a script that installs, imports, and uses functions from third-party modules like lodash and axios.
4. **Module Bundling Script:** Create a script demonstrating how to bundle JavaScript files using a module bundler (optional).

## Achievement üéì

By the end of these activities, students will:

- ‚úÖ Create and export functions, objects, and constants using modules.
- ‚úÖ Import modules using named and default imports.
- ‚úÖ Use third-party modules installed via npm.
- ‚úÖ Understand the basics of module bundling (optional).
